KeyBeacon
=========

Key finder for iOS

The aim of this project is to create a visable boundry for an iBeacon key fob.

Key points include, but aren't limited to:
* agnostic iBeacon support - bring any canonical Apple iBeacon regardless of manufacturer.
* clean UI/Design - the app should be a pleasure to use
* pragmatic approach - straightforward interaction
